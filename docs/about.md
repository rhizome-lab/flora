# About Flora

Flora is a Rhizome ecosystem monorepo containing Lua projects, seeds, and documentation.

## Naming

The Rhizome ecosystem uses botanical naming. Flora (this repo) contains flowering projects:

### Iris

Agent-authored insights from coding sessions.

Named for the flower, but also the part of the eye that controls how much light enters - fitting for a tool that helps "see" what happened in sessions and controls what insights come through.

### Wisteria

Autonomous task execution agent.

Named for the climbing vine that grows persistently and finds its way around obstacles - fitting for an agent that works through complex tasks step by step, adapting as it goes.

### Seeds

Project templates for nursery scaffolding.

Seeds grow into new projects, naturally.

## Ecosystem

Flora is part of the Rhizome ecosystem:

- **rhizome** - The root system connecting everything
- **spore** - Lua runtime (spores spread and germinate)
- **moss** - Code intelligence (moss grows on and understands its substrate)
- **nursery** - Project scaffolding (where seeds are planted)
- **flora** - Flowering applications (iris, wisteria)

All botanical. All connected underground.
